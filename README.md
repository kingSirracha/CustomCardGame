# Custom Card Game

A personal project that started with the question "can we make a digital version of Blank White Cards?". If you're unfamiliar with it Blank White Cards usually called 1000 Blank White Cards is a game where cards are usually made by the very people playing them. Everyone gets together, comes up with fun ideas for cards, and then they put all the cards in the same deck. After playing a few games with different groups, a friend of mine initally thought of and attempted the challange of converting the endless sea of options to the digital format. While theory crafting for my own attempt a different idea branched from the initial. "There's many deckbuilders out there but what about crafting the cards themselves?" and so the Idea for the Custom card game project began. Now here and there I add more and more to the project as time goes on.

# The Current State

Little did I know programming UI, Deck mechanics, Saving Decks, etc... for even the base of a card game takes a good chunk of time. So far Cards can be drawn, played and discarded with the framework for individual card mechanics in place. You can name cards and the mantian across sessions but a UI for adding in the gameplay elements of Cards has yet to be in place. The overall goal is getting some kind of singleplayer mode working at some point but the more immediate goal is a UI for adding and removing a card's gameplay properties while creating some in the process.
